Encore is a clone of [SongKick][songkick], and allows a user to pick some
locations of interest, track their favorite artists, and see when they're coming
to their area. Encore is built with single-page functionality in mind, and relies
on backbone to render views within the app without refreshing. Encore makes use
of the Spotify API to fetch artist photos on the fly.

## Using the Site
Click the log-in button in the top right corner, or one of the links on the main
banner, to visit the log-in screen. This will present you with an option to sign
in as a guest user. Once signed in, feel free to navigate the various sections
of the app from the navbar at the top of the page. The guest user has a few
randomly selected artists and locations set by default as 'tracking'. Tracking
an additional artist or location means the dashboard view will offer additional
concerts as suggestions. After tracking a concert, it will be viewable in 'your
plans' for future reference. Currently no search feature is enabled, so try not
to 'untrack' all artists or locations. ;)
